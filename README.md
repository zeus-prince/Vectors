# VECTORS implementation


A **VECTOR** is a object that has magnitude(length) and direction. It is generally represented graphically as a arrow connecting connecting an initial point A with a terminal point B and denoted by \overrightarrow{AB} .

vectors are fundamental in the maths, physics and engineering. They can be used to represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. vectors describe many physical quantities such as force, velocity,linear displacement, linear acceleration, angular acceleration, linear momentum, angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition are angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.

### Note : ###
This repository contains implementation of mathematical concept of "VECTORS" in python. This code is written in Python 3.6.2 . The program vector.py uses the math library to use acos and atan2 function.

Any suggestions and bug-reports are welcome and please feel free
to play around and change my code if necessary
